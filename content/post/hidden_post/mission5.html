			<h1>Mission 5: The Death Star</h1>
			<p> “Great job making it this far! The force is certainly with you… But good luck navigating the chaos that is the Social Sciences and Humanities Building, more commonly referred to as the Death Star. Notorious for making students late for class, the Death Star’s lawless, maze-like architecture and unconventional numbering system confuses everyone. If you’re lucky enough to have a class here, be sure to set time aside to physically find the classroom.”

			“Oh no, it seems like the fog is creeping up from the lower levels! I’ve got a bad feeling about this…”

			“In order to escape, we need to unscramble the name of the next location!”
