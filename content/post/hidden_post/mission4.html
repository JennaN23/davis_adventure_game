			<p> Behold the famous UC Davis eggheads. The library is open from 7:30 to 12:00 am and here you can always find poor Ochem students with their nose in a book. If your desire to study is unusually strong, the 24-hour study rooms are the place for you.
			<br>
			<br>
			Here you must search for knowledge.. The knowledge of the final destination. We know that the fog originates from a hall on campus.. But which? The famous bookhead will offer you some insight.
			</br>
			<br>
			Bookhead: "Humph"
			</br>
			<br>
			You walk into the library and hear an ominous breathing noise disturb the tranquil silence of students hard at work. It sounds awfully like a certain masked character who wields a lightsaber. There’s a certain building on campus whose name resembles his favored ship where he might be found …
