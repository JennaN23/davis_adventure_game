			<h1>Mission 4: The Library</h1>
			<p> “Behold the famous UC Davis eggheads. The library is open from 7:30 to 12:00 am and here you can always find poor Ochem students with their nose in a book. If your desire to study is unusually strong, the 24-hour study rooms are the place for you.”
			<br>
			<br>
			“Here you must search for knowledge.. The knowledge of the final destination. We know that the fog originates from a hall on campus.. But which? The famous bookhead will offer you some insight.”
