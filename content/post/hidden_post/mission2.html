			<p> Wow! You have a knack... for reading. Well done. Now the real work starts. 
			The fog appears to be coming from a certain hall on campus. 
			But, first, make sure you are drinking lots of water and have eaten enough. 
			These missions can be very tiring, and you cannot work on low energy.

			<br/>
			Here at the Silo, there are often various food trucks, restaurants, and even a market.
			The local cows have asked me to relay a message to you regarding their observations. 
			They have seen the fog workers moving around in secret throughout the day, and they seem to have left breadcrumbs on their trail.
		    A note was found by the cow leader during peace negotiations with the horses... It reads
