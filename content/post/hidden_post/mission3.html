			<h1>Mission2: Student Community Center</h1>
			<p> “Here we are at the Student Community Center, a building through which students often bustle around due to the vast resources it houses. Here, you can find the <a href="https://ccc.ucdavis.edu/">Cross Cultural Center</a> and the  <a href="https://urc.ucdavis.edu/">Undergraduate Research Center</a> which can enrich your student experience. You can also find various study locations here for all the group study sessions that I am sure you will be having along with some coffee from the CoHo to keep you awake! However, with this dense fog over campus, there’s not another soul in sight…be brave, I have faith in your success!”

			<br>
			<br>
			“Looking up, you see the dark fog creeping eerily close, you notice a strange image painted on the large glass windows of the building. It almost looks like a…circle? No…maybe an egg? Looks almost like an egg reading a book. With this clue, you begin to cautiously move in the direction opposite to the fog, keeping an eye out for a giant egg focused on an open book that is renowned for giving good luck to students prior to exams.”
